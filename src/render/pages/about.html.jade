p.
  My name is John Batte, and I'm a software architect. Basically, that means I get to work
  with some pretty smart people and design some pretty interesting systems for businesses
  that need a smart solution to their problems. I love what I do, and I love it when a colleague
  gets that "Eureka!" moment and I'm there to witness it. We all grow and learn and when we do so
  as a community, we grow beyond our individual limits -- that's why I love Open Source software
  so much! I hope to one day be recognized as a significant contributor to the Open space, and I
  hope to always be learning along the way!

  | I'm the owner of an organization called 
  a(href=site.links.tribe) The Tribe 
  | on GitHub (that's "Tribe" as in a large group of monkeys; code monkeys to be specific). 
  | Together we are working on a few really interesting ideas and we all hope that you find 
  | our projects as interesting and useful as we do.

  | If you ever need an answer to a question regarding one of our projects, or just about development 
  | in general, please feel free to 
  a(href=getEmail()) reach out to me 
  | via email, or 
  a(href=site.links.newRequest) submit an issue 
  | with my profile site's repository -- I'll treat issues submitted there as personal requests directed at me.
