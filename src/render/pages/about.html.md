My name is John Batte, and I'm a software architect. Basically, that means I get to work with some pretty smart people and design some pretty interesting systems for businesses that need a smart solution to their problems. I love what I do, and I love it when a colleague gets that "Eureka!" moment and I'm there to witness it. We all grow and learn and when we do so as a community, we grow beyond our individual limits -- that's why I love Open Source software so much! I hope to one day be recognized as a significant contributor to the Open space, and I hope to always be learning along the way!

I'm the owner of an organization called [The Tribe][tribe] on GitHub (that's "Tribe" as in a large group of monkeys; code monkeys to be specific). Together we are working on a few really interesting ideas and we all hope that you find our projects as interesting and useful as we do.

If you ever need an answer to a question regarding one of our projects, or just about development in general, please feel free to [reach out to me][email] via email, or [submit an issue][issue] with my profile site's repository -- I'll treat issues submitted there as personal requests directed at me.
