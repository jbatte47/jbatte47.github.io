I've attempted to commit my thoughts to some sort of medium like a blog or at least a journal on several previous occasions, and each attempt failed because my plans all sounded good in theory but fell apart in practice.

I'd set aside a certain amount of time each day for it. Well that didn't work because events don't often adhere to your personal schedule.

I carried a journal around with me for a while, but that didn't work either. It felt as if I needed to have a complete thought ready to commit to writing before using up a page.

Then there's the panoply of frameworks to choose from, even within the static generator group. I've just switched again (this time it's DocPad) because, like the one before it, and the one before that, my last blogging engine (Ruhoh) promises a lot but ultimately ties your hands. DocPad seems so far to be far less prescriptive while being just as capable as any of the others. It should work better... but that won't be the silver bullet.

I'm willing to admit to myself that I most likely won't have time to write every article that occurs to me, even if I drop a lot of side activities and boost its focus in my life. There simply isn't that much time in a day. So, I'm adjusting my expectations for myself to this: I will blog when I do have time, but I expect that will be seldom. Instead, as I have little thoughts throughout the day, I will do my best to tweet them and list those tweets on this site. That way I won't be losing all the little thoughts that pop into my head. They've been going to `/dev/null` for too long.
