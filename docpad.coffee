    # Helper Functions
    # ----------------

    # Get the prepared site/document title
    # Often we would like to specify particular formatting to our page's title
    # we can apply that formatting here
    getPreparedTitle: ->
      # if we have a document title, then we should use that and suffix the site's title onto it
      if @document.title
        "#{@document.title} | #{@site.title}"
      # if our document does not have it's own title, then we should just use the site's title
      else
        @site.title

    # Get the prepared site/document description
    getPreparedDescription: ->
      # if we have a document description, then we should use that, otherwise use the site's description
      @document.description or @site.description

    # Get the prepared site/document keywords
    getPreparedKeywords: ->
      # Merge the document keywords with the site keywords
      @site.keywords.concat(@document.keywords or []).join(', ')


  # Collections
  # ===========
  # These are special collections that our website makes available to us

  collections:
    # For instance, this one will fetch in all documents that have pageOrder set within their meta data
    pages: (database) ->
      database.findAllLive({pageOrder: $exists: true}, [pageOrder:1,title:1])

    # This one, will fetch in all documents that will be outputted to the posts directory
    posts: (database) ->
      database.findAllLive({relativeOutDirPath:'posts'},[date:-1])


  # DocPad Events
  # =============

  # Here we can define handlers for events that DocPad fires
  # You can find a full listing of events on the DocPad Wiki
  events:

    # Server Extend
    # Used to add our own custom routes to the server before the docpad routes are added
    serverExtend: (opts) ->
      # Extract the server from the options
      {server} = opts
      docpad = @docpad

      # As we are now running in an event,
      # ensure we are using the latest copy of the docpad configuraiton
      # and fetch our urls from it
      latestConfig = docpad.getConfig()
      oldUrls = latestConfig.templateData.site.oldUrls or []
      newUrl = latestConfig.templateData.site.url

      # Redirect any requests accessing one of our sites oldUrls to the new site url
      server.use (req,res,next) ->
        if req.headers.host in oldUrls
          res.redirect 301, newUrl+req.url
        else
          next()


# Export our DocPad Configuration
module.exports = docpadConfig
